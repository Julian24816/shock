# shock simulation todos

- [x] finish implementing simple game with any rules
- [x] simulate 10k games
- [ ] implement different agents
- [ ] support different game rules
- [ ] profile performance
- [ ] simulate 1M games each with different rulesets & agent combinations

# ideas

- [ ] interactive agent that allows user to join as player
  - [ ] i18n for different local dialects (including local rules?)
  - [ ] ML for replicating the users playstyle
- [ ] gui mode with simple graphics to play as game
- [ ] live statistical evaluation during large simulation runs
- [ ] ML for creating the best strategy

# paper

- [ ] find more literature relevant to simulating dice games
- [ ] write a mathematical / probability analysis section
- [ ] write about code structure, performance optimizations and agent algorithms
- [ ] write about collected results
